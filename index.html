        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect personal information such as your name, email address, and password when signing up or using our services via Firebase Authentication. This information is only used for the purpose of providing authentication and user account management.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected to authenticate your identity and provide access to our services. Your email address is used for login and verification purposes, while your password is stored securely to protect your account.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your personal data is stored securely using encryption and other security measures.
